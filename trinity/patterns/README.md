# Trinity Patterns Directory

This directory contains documented patterns, anti-patterns, and best practices discovered during development and investigation sessions.

## Pattern Categories

### Code Patterns
- **React Component Patterns**: Effective React component design patterns
- **State Management Patterns**: Redux, Context API, and local state patterns
- **Hook Patterns**: Custom hook design and usage patterns
- **Performance Patterns**: React performance optimization patterns

### Architecture Patterns
- **Service Layer Patterns**: API service design patterns
- **Data Flow Patterns**: Application data flow architectures
- **Error Handling Patterns**: Consistent error handling approaches
- **Configuration Patterns**: Environment and feature configuration patterns

### Anti-Patterns
- **Performance Anti-Patterns**: Common performance pitfalls to avoid
- **React Anti-Patterns**: React-specific anti-patterns and their solutions
- **Architecture Anti-Patterns**: System design pitfalls
- **Testing Anti-Patterns**: Testing approaches that cause problems

## Pattern Documentation Format

Each pattern should be documented with:
- **Pattern Name**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Problem**: What problem does this pattern solve?
- **Solution**: How does the pattern solve the problem?
- **Implementation**: Code examples and implementation details
- **Benefits**: Why use this pattern?
- **Trade-offs**: What are the costs or limitations?
- **Examples**: Real-world usage examples from the codebase
- **Related Patterns**: Connections to other patterns

## Pattern Discovery Sources

### From Investigation Sessions
Patterns emerge from debugging and investigation work

### From Code Reviews
Patterns identified during code review processes

### From Performance Analysis
Patterns discovered during performance optimization

### From Architecture Reviews
Patterns found during architectural analysis

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Reference in Code**: Link to patterns in code comments where applicable
2. **Share Knowledge**: Use patterns for team training and onboarding
3. **Evolve Patterns**: Update patterns as understanding improves
4. **Validate Patterns**: Ensure patterns are tested and proven effective

## Integration with Trinity Method

Patterns integrate with other Trinity components:
- **Sessions**: Investigation sessions discover and validate patterns
- **Knowledge Base**: Patterns contribute to organizational knowledge
- **Templates**: Pattern templates for common investigation types
